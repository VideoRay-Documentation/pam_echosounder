<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>

<ol>
  <li><h3>What is the Tritech Echosounder?</h3>
  <p>The Tritech Echosounder is an acoustic device that can be used to determine the altitude of the ROV above the seafloor.</p></li>

  <li><h3>Is this the only way to attach the Tritech Echosounder?</h3>
  <p>No. The normal connection for the Tritech Echosounder is to simply plug it directly into the ROV's accessory port and use the spare pair.  This document is provided as an example of a PAM configuration and may be useful for certain accessory configurations.</p></li>

  <li><h3>Are there any advantages to using the PAM to connect the Tritech Echosounder?</h3>
  <p>Without the PAM the Tritech Echosounder defaults to using the ROV's spare pair exclusively.  This prevents any other device from making use of the spare pair. By configuring the Tritech Echosounder through the PAM, we can free up the spare pair for other accessories that use it, such as a sonar accessory.</p></li>
