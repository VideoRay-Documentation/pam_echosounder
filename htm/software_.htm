<h1>Software Configuration</h1>

<p>To begin the software configuration, connect the PAM as described in the connection section. Connect the ROV to it's panel. Once the ROV is connected to the echosounder properly, power on the laptop and turn on the panel, but do not start VideoRay Cockpit.  The light on the PAM should blink twice as it executes the bootloader, and then emit a single blink every few seconds if it is receiving power. When the PAM begins communicating, it will emit a series of blinks every few seconds.</p>

<p>Even though the device is connected, we need to tell the PAM what device it's communicating with. While some devices are generic multiplexer devices, we have a more specific setup for the Echosounder that allows its integration into VideoRay Cockpit, including displaying the ROV's altitude on the video overlay text and enabling auto altitude.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the cockpit installation directory. The default directory is <span class="folder">C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoRay\vrCockpit</span>.</li>
  <li>Open vrDeviceConfiguration.exe.</li>
  <li>Click the ? button at the bottom of the utility to enumerate the PAM.</li>
  <li>If your PAM is connected correctly, you should see a listing in the left window of vrDeviceConfig. Click it.</li>
  <li>Click the ID button at the bottom of the utility to fill in the ID field.</li>
  <li>In the Device RS-485 dropdown menu, select "Yes."</li>
  <li>In the Device Type dropdown menu, select "Altimeter."
  <li>Leave all other options as they are and click the floppy disk icon at the bottom to save your settings.</li>
  <li>Connect your ROV to the panel normally, and power the panel on.</li>
  <li>Start cockpit. Click the double gear icon in the toolbar to modify settings. Click the checkbox next to "allow altitude display."</li>
  <li>Depth and altitude should now display overlayed on the main video window, and the depth meter should now show altitude as well.</li>
