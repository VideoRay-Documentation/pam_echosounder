<h1>Product Overview</h1>

<p>This guide serves as an appendix to the primary PAM manual. In this guide we will display the correct configuration for a Tritech Micron Echosounder configured for the PAM.  The echosounder usually makes use of the spare pair, making it exclusive with other accessories that also used the spare pair. By instead routing the Echosounder through a PAM module, we can free the spare pair for use by another accessory that may use it, such as sonar or a zoom 
camera. You will need the following materials for this connection:</p>
